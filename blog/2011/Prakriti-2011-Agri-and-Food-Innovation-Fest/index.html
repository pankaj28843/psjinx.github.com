                    <h4>Initiation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Idea for organizing Prakriti came to some of our seniors in 2009 after seeing kind of frustration in students of our department when they were not getting good jobs, good internships etc. in this field. Some reasons were like unawareness between students regarding scope of this field and kind of weak bonding between Agricultural and Food Indutries and our department. Everyone was saying "Curricula Change Karao Ghasi Ka, Ye Sab Padh Ke Job Nahin Lagne Waali ". But one can not change a well established system just by organizing a panel discussion or some fest. Anyway, we started contacting our alumnus, different comapnies and colleges to take part and finally Prakriti'10 happened from 2nd to 4th April, 2010. Response was good both from our Professers, Industry and participating colleges and everyone asked us to move forward with Prakriti&#39;11.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why I wanted to be part of Prakriti and how it helped me</h4>
                    <p>
                        I developed a "KEEDA " inside me for working on computers in my 1st and 2nd years and had feeling for contributing to Prakriti'10 website. But when I joined Team Prakriti'10, website was already up and seniors asked me to do some designing related works using Photoshop.
                        <br/> Personally, I earned lot of things during Prakriti'10, one of them was interaction with lot of departmental seniors and got to know <i>"What to do and what not to do when you are a <b>Ghasi</b>
                        </i>. One of them was "Apni CV Ghasi se Jitna Door Rakhoge Utna Hi PEACE Rahega Life Mein". It sounds kind of absurd after having Prakriti&#39;11 but this was the funda given to me at that point of time.
                        <br/> Finally, I got back to programming due to this funda and learned Django Framework of Python during summer holidays. This helped me in being part of Overnite, an online coding contest organized during tech fest of IIT Kharagpur. I got a chance to work with Mr. Varun Kumar, an agfe senior, during last winters and developed Prakriti&#39;11 website as well. Finally, I got to know lot of good coders in IIT Kharagpur after this.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why we went for Prakriti&#39;11</h4>
                    <p>
                        As I said prevously, a platform was missing where students in this field could interact with Industry people. Many companies are not aware of the fact that there is one AgFE Department in IIT Kharagpur and why they should take us in Food Industry instead of Chemical Engineers, in Land and Water Resources related Industry instead of Civil Engineers and in Tractor Industry instead of Mechanical Engineers. Why are we better than all of them as far as our particular field is concerned. Generally, all of us from this field find other jobs like IT and Finance more fascinating than working for a tractor or food company. One of the reasons was wrong interpretation of being a Ghasi and we wanted to change this interpretation by both companies and students.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What happened during Prakriti&#39;11 and how was response</h4>
                    <p>
                        Prakriti&#39;11 happened from 11th to 13th March, 2011 and we had around 100 participants from different agricultural engineering colleges across the country. Many events, workshops were organized during these 3 days -
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Symposium - an interaction between industry and acadmia</li>
                            <li>Agripreneurship Workshop</li>
                            <li>Tech Villa - workshops on automation, tea and IT in agriculture</li>
                            <li>Innovation Workshop by John Deere</li>
                            <li>Sustainability Workshop by Tetrapak</li>
                            <li>Vantage - an innovative fun event</li>
                            <li>Quiz</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                        I think, Prakriti&#39;11 helped participants to get an insight about what's there in blackbox of companies in Agricultural and Food industries and what can they do there.
                        <br/> This time in Prakriti we tried for some online events like Online Quiz and Online Video submission on Sustainability. Online Quiz saw much more than expected traffic in first 3-4 four days due to which we needed to upgrade our hosting plan because bandwidth use was going to be a problem and no one was in mood to stop the fever. This fever continued for 10 continuous days and we saw more than 20,000 attempts for answerng different question by more than 200 players. The addiction factor behind this simple application was Countdown Timer. This timer which was responsible for linear decay in maximum marks after a soft time limit. Same thing happened with Online Video submissions and we had total 8 submissions on were Facebok page which lead to more than 2500 likes in 15 days.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Plan for Prakriti'12</h4>
                    <p>
                        Everyone is excited to have Prakriti'12 and we are getting very much positive response from participants and our professors. Let's see what happens !!!
